Broader context Aqueous zinc (Zn) metal-based electrochemical devices (ECDs) have emerged as promising candidates for grid energy storage owing to their high safety, low cost, environmental benignity, and abundant Zn resources. However, practical Zn-based ECDs are plagued by uncontrolled dendrite growth and notorious side reactions, particularly exacerbated at high currents/capacities or extreme temperatures. Despite notable advancements in electrolyte manipulation to tackle these issues, the correlation between anionic property and the interface induced remains equivocal. We devise dual-anion electrolytes by hybridization of distinct polar anions to generate a comparative framework. Herein, a strong polar acetate anion coupled with a trifluoromethanesulfonate anion (OTf(cid:2)) emerged as an optimal combination through synchronous regulation of the bulk solvation and interface layer. In the symmetric Zn cell, prolonged cycle life is realized at 10 mA cm(cid:2)2 and 10 mA h cm(cid:2)2, yielding an ultrahigh cumulative plating capacity of 15.25 A h cm(cid:2)2 (3050 h), which surpasses state-of-the-art high- capacity Zn anodes. Furthermore, low temperature adaptability and high temperature (60 1C) tolerance are also enabled. Both the assembled Zn8AC hybrid capacitors and Zn8air batteries demonstrate the potential to enhance the lifespan of Zn-based ECDs. This study contributes to the fundamental principle for modulating advanced electrolytes through anion chemistry towards high-performance Zn-based electrochemical devices.

Introduction

Aqueous zinc (Zn) metal-based electrochemical devices (ECDs) have emerged as promising candidates for large-scale energy storage owing to the intrinsic features of high safety, low cost, environmental benignity, and abundant Zn resources.1–4 However, the development of aqueous Zn-based ECDs is pla- gued by uncontrolled dendrite growth and notorious side reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. It has been well

accepted that the electric double layer (EDL) consists of a compact layer and a dispersed layer. In the realm of the compact layer, the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) arises due to the specific adsorption of electrolyte constituents, while the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP) is occupied by fully solvated cations.5 Under an electric field, the solvated Zn2+ gradually detaches from coordinated water, crossing the OHP to reach the IHP, followed by the electroreduction of Zn2+ and intricate interference of de-solvated water decomposition in the vicinity of the Zn surface.6–9 At high currents and capacities, the mismatch between the supply and consumption of Zn2+ at the electrode/electrolyte interface becomes surged, posing a great challenge to achieve dendrite-free electroplating. There- fore, the EDL and solvation structure dominate the evolution of the interface, which serve as pivotal factors in determining Zn deposition behaviour and subsequent cycling capability.5,10

Electrolyte manipulation with a direct eﬀect on the solvation structure and interfacial micro-environment has attracted extensive attention to address the issues. The current studies focus on the following three approaches: (i) employing cosol- vents to substitute water and form a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer;11–14 (ii) introducing low-concentration additives as EDL regulators to isolate reactive water from contacting the Zn electrode, constrain 2D diffusion of Zn2+ and/or form a SEI;15–20 (iii) constructing a ‘‘water in salt’’ system to decrease free water and increase contact ion pairs in favor of the anion-derived SEI.1,21,22 Despite considerable advances, potential issues caused by these approaches can arise, such as compromised intrinsic safety and ionic conductivity of the aqueous electro- lyte, unendurable protection, and elevated electrolyte viscosity and cost. Hence, it remains highly desirable to engineer elec- trolytes in pursuit of inheriting the advantages of aqueous electrolytes and enhancing the stability of the interface for sustainable Zn electrodes. Furthermore, salt anions not only compete with the solvent for coordinating Zn2+ but also feature specific adsorption on the Zn surface, thereby concurrently shaping the solvation structure and EDL.23–28 Nevertheless, the correlation between the anionic property and the induced interface is ambiguous. To this end, the priority is to establish selection criteria of anions for interconnecting their effect on the bulk solvation and interfacial EDL. Additionally, it is imperative to clarify that synchronous regulation of the bulk solvation and EDL is fundamental for long-life Zn electrodes. Herein, we present a comparative and mechanistic study on engineering dual-anion electrolytes for durable Zn electrodes by anion-polarity hybridization chemistry. Zinc trifluoromethane- sulfonate (Zn(OTf)2) is chosen as the baseline salt due to its high dissociation and favorable reduction products.29 Zinc acetate (Zn(Ac)2) and zinc trifluoroacetate (Zn(TFA)2) are intro- duced as regulatory salts for constructing a dual-anion environ- ment with Zn(OTf)2, respectively. Notably, OTf(cid:2), Ac(cid:2) and TFA(cid:2) feature similar structures (Fig. S1, ESI†), which can exclude the eﬀect of spatial configuration and valence state. Theoretical calculation and experimental characterization reveal that the strong-polarity Ac(cid:2) not only participates in the formation of the primary solvation shell of Zn2+ but also redistributes

ions for a Zn2+-enriched Helmholtz layer. the interfacial Meanwhile, the weak-polarity OTf(cid:2) is promoted to coordinate Zn2+, capable of forming a complete and dense SEI. Benefiting from the optimized dual-anion combination, the symmetric Zn cell attains extended cycling stability at 10 mA cm(cid:2)2 and 10 mA h cm(cid:2)2, harvesting an ultrahigh cumulative plating capacity of 15.25 A h cm(cid:2)2 (3050 h), exceeding state-of-the-art high-capacity Zn anodes. Furthermore, varying low temperature adaptability and hightemperature (60 1C) tolerance are demon- strated. The assembled Zn8active carbon hybrid capacitors and Zn8air batteries showcase the feasibility of enhancing the life- span of Zn-based ECDs with the designed electrolyte. This work sheds light on the fundamental mechanisms underlying dual- anion electrolytes towards durable Zn electrodes, paving the way for devising anion chemistry in metal electrode protection.

Results and discussion

Electrostatic potential maps (ESPs) were obtained by density- functional theory (DFT) calculations to visualize the charge spatial distribution surrounding the three kinds of anions (Fig. 1a). The methyl in Ac(cid:2) exerts an electron-donating eﬀect whereas trifluoromethyl in OTf(cid:2) and TFA(cid:2) intensely withdraws electrons, which results in electron delocalization. Thus, Ac(cid:2) reveals strong polarity, creating a higher electrostatic driving force for cation access ((cid:2)5.93 eV) in comparison with weak- polarity OTf(cid:2) ((cid:2)4.93 eV) and medium-polarity TFA(cid:2) ((cid:2)5.39 eV). This gains further validation through calculating interactions of Zn2+–H2O and different Zn2+–anion pairs, among which Ac(cid:2) manifests the highest binding energy with Zn2+ (in absolute value), followed by Zn2+–TFA(cid:2), Zn2+–OTf(cid:2) and Zn2+–H2O in descending order (Fig. 1b). Therefore, Ac(cid:2) is inclined to engage in the formation of a Zn2+ solvation shell by squeezing out partial water molecules, thereby preventing water-associated side reactions. Given that the high-polarity organic group is the preferential adsorption site,30 Ac(cid:2) is envisioned as the targeted secondary anion for synchronous regulation of the solvation structure and EDL, as discussed in the following section.

The solvation structures of diﬀerent electrolytes were experi- mentally investigated through a series of spectroscopic charac- terization studies. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was first performed to unveil the solvation structure evolution of the baseline, 0.1 M Ac(cid:2)-addition and 0.7 M Ac(cid:2)-addition electro- lytes, which are denoted as 2 OTf, 2F-01A and 2F-07A, respectively, (Fig. 1c and Fig. S3, ESI†). Note that the addition of 0.7 M regulatory salt is near the upper dissolution threshold for dual- anion electrolytes (Fig. S2, ESI†). With Zn(Ac)2 powder as a reference, the diﬀerence (D) of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) peaks between the symmetric stretching vibration (B1400 cm(cid:2)1) and the antisymmetric stretching vibration (B1550 cm(cid:2)1) of CQO can be utilized as a probe of the bonding configuration of Zn2+ and Ac(cid:2). 2F-07A shows distinct characteristic CQO peaks with enhanced D values in contrast to the baseline and 2F-01A, implying more monodentate coor- dination of Ac(cid:2) with Zn2+.31 In combination with solubility and

the ability to penetrate the solvation sheath of Zn2+, 0.7 M was preliminarily identified as the optimal concentration of Ac(cid:2)- containing electrolytes. To persuasively assess the impacts of the dual-anion concentration and anion polarity on the electro- chemical performance and the underlying mechanism, we introduced a low concentration 0.1 M Ac(cid:2)-regulated electrolyte (2F-01A) and a 0.7 M medium polarity TFA(cid:2)-regulated electro- lyte (2F-07FA) in the subsequent analysis. The distinct manage- ment of these electrolytes in the bulk solvation and the interfacial EDL was also demonstrated thereafter.

The O–H stretching vibration of H2O in FTIR is decoupled into strong H-bonds (B3280 cm(cid:2)1), medium H-bonds (B3470 cm(cid:2)1) and weak-H bonds (3580 cm(cid:2)1). With regulatory anions added to the baseline electrolyte, strong H-bonds slightly increase following the order of 2F-07A 4 2F-07FA 4 2F-01A. While for medium H-bonds and weak H-bonds, the reversed trend is observed, which is ascribed to the decreased capability of H-bond formation between the anion and H2O in the order of Ac(cid:2), TFA(cid:2) and OTf(cid:2) (Fig. S4, ESI†). In Raman spectra, the –SO3 stretching band of OTf(cid:2) can be divided into free anions (FAs, OTf(cid:2)) at B1028 cm(cid:2)1, solvent- separated ion pairs (SSIP, Zn2+–H2O–OTf(cid:2)) at B1035 cm(cid:2)1 and

contact ion pairs (CIP, Zn2+–OTf(cid:2)) at B1042 cm(cid:2)1 (Fig. 1d and Fig. S5–S7, ESI†).32,33 The CIP ratio decreases in the order of 2F-07FA 4 2F-07A 4 2F-01A 4 2OTf due to the differences in the entropy effect and involved solvent numbers (Table S1, ESI†). 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR) exhibits an upfield shift as regulatory anions are added into both water and the baseline, which is attributed to the decrease of the electron cloud density around the hydrogen nucleus caused by the special coordination environment regulated by Ac(cid:2) and TFA(cid:2) (Fig. S8, ESI†). Meanwhile, the 17O NMR of OTf(cid:2) resonance becomes broader and weaker with regulatory salt addition, indicative of more OTf(cid:2) squeezing into the Zn2+ solvation sheath in optimal dual-anion electrolytes, evidencing the Raman find- ings in Fig. 1e. The negligible characteristic peaks in the 67Zn NMR spectra in both 2F-07A and 2F-07FA electrolytes suggest a significantly declined Zn2+ exchange rate during the acquisition further confirming the anion-enriched coordination time, environment (Fig. 1f).34

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in conjunction with corresponding radial distribution functions (RDFs) and coordi- nation number (CN) were then performed to probe the

evolution of the Zn2+-solvation structure (Fig. 1g–j and Fig. S9 and S10, ESI†). For the baseline electrolyte of 2 M Zn(OTf)2, Zn2+ is primarily surrounded by six water molecules with a sharp peak at 2 Å corresponding to the distance of Zn–H2O pairs. In Ac(cid:2)-containing electrolytes, a distinct coordination peak located at 1.9 Å emerges, verifying a stronger interaction of Ac(cid:2)–Zn2+ than that of H2O–Zn2+. Upon elevating the Zn(Ac)2 concentration from 0.1 M to 0.7 M, the CN of Ac(cid:2) and OTf(cid:2) increases from 0.079 to 0.448 and from 0.117 to 0.145, respectively, accompanied by a decrease in coordinated water. While for the TFA(cid:2)-containing electrolyte, 0.403 of TFA(cid:2) and 0.358 of OTf(cid:2) enter the first solvation shell of Zn2+. Apparently, dual-anion electrolytes promote the evolution of the anion- enriched solvation structure, which is found to be advanta- geous for an anion-induced SEI, as discussed later. H-bonds were also simulated in Fig. S11 (ESI†), which shows a substan- tial decrease in 0.7 M-addition dual-anion electrolytes. Anion squeezing into the solvated structure with 0.7 M regulatory salt addition is statistically presented in Fig. S12 (ESI†), showing that OTf(cid:2) and regulatory anions exist in the solvation structure

of Zn2+, respectively. The calculated Gibbs free energy for different solvation shells of Zn2+ incorporating single anion participation is shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†), following the order of Zn(H2O)5OTf(cid:2) o Zn(H2O)5TFA(cid:2) o Zn(H2O)5Ac(cid:2) (in absolute value), which well explains the crucial role of anion polarity in shaping the Zn2+-solvation sheath.

Besides modulating the solvation structure of Zn2+, the regulatory anions with strong polarity would preferentially adsorb on the Zn metal surface and manipulate IHP, thus directing the Zn deposition pattern. To this end, the ability of anions to donate electrons was investigated by the molecular orbital level to evaluate the adsorption priority.35,36 As sum- marized in Fig. 2a, Ac(cid:2) has the highest value of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) due to the presence of electron-rich oxygen atoms, in favor of transferring electrons to the metal surface atoms, which implies the potential of Ac(cid:2) as the IHP regulator. Adsorption energy (Ead) was subsequently calculated using DFT to determine the adsorption preference of these anions and water molecules on the Zn(101) facet (Fig. 2b and Fig. S14, ESI†). Ac(cid:2) has a higher interaction with a Zn slab

showing an Ead value of (cid:2)2.77 eV in comparison with other anions ((cid:2)2.64 eV for TFA(cid:2), and (cid:2)2.49 eV for OTf(cid:2)) and water molecules ((cid:2)0.25 eV), matching well with HOMO energy level results. The lowest zeta potential of Zn powder in 2F-07A also confirms that Ac(cid:2) accumulates more on the Zn surface than anions in other electrolytes (Fig. S15, ESI†). Moreover, the electric double layer capacitance (EDLC) resulted from the adsorbed species and composition structure of the interface was collected by fitting cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves at diﬀerent scan rates (Fig. 2c and Fig. S16, ESI†).37,38 It is evident that the addition of Zn(Ac)2 significantly enhances the EDLC, leading to a capacitance of 98.17 mF cm(cid:2)2, which is approxi- mately 4-fold higher than that of 2F-07FA. Since the EDLC is strongly associated with the Helmholtz layer,5 it is instructive to ascertain the capacitance contribution in the Helmholtz layer. To understand the discrepancy between Ac(cid:2) and TFA(cid:2) as regulatory anions in manipulating the EDL structure, MD simulations are employed to scrutinize the chemical structure of EDL in 2F-07A and 2F-07FA. The side-view snapshots of EDL in the simulated electrolytes are shown in Fig. S17 and S18 (ESI†) and the representative top-view snapshots of the adsorbed species in the Helmholtz layer are displayed in Fig. 2d and e and Fig. S19 (ESI†). The amount of the ions in the Helmholtz layer is collected in Fig. S20 (ESI†). At the initial state, there is a clear surplus of Ac(cid:2) in 2F-07A compared to TFA(cid:2) in 2F-07FA, thus forming an anion-enriched interface, which can draw more Zn2+ to gather for charge compensation. At a bias voltage of (cid:2)100 mV (directed at the electroplating process), the number of Zn2+ transporting into the Helmholtz layer in 2F-07A surpasses that in 2F-07FA. The solvation struc- tures of the two electrolytes in the EDL are disclosed in Fig. 2f and g, which demonstrates the enhanced anion coordination (the CN of OTf(cid:2) and both regulatory anions E1) due to the rearrangement of interfacial constituents.

Furthermore, the normalized density profiles are recorded to show the distribution of interfacial ions along the distance from the Zn electrode surface within the EDL (Fig. 2h and i). The closer distance (0.41 nm) and higher density of Ac(cid:2) is accompanied by Zn2+ in more proximity to the Zn electrode (0.63 nm), thus contributing to a more condensed Helmholtz layer, in good agreement with the significantly enhanced EDLC for 2F-07A in Fig. 2c. When the potential was applied to the two systems, the 2F-07A system showed the opposite changing trend in the number density of anions and cations located in the Helmholtz layer (within 1 nm of the electrode), which is more conspicuous compared to the observation in 2F-07FA. Meanwhile, both Zn2+ and Ac(cid:2) in 2F-07A retain a higher diﬀu- sion coeﬃcient as compared to Zn2+ and TFA(cid:2) in 2F-07FA with/ without a bias voltage (Fig. S21, ESI†). This stark contrast suggests that the Zn2+-rich interface in 2F-07A is expected to counter rapid electrode reaction consumption in the EDL, ensuring dendrite-free electrodeposition, whereas the 2F-07FA system is more inclined to conduct uneven deposition owing to the insuﬃcient Zn2+ supply. In addition, 2F-07A and 2F-07FA showcase consistent levels of viscosity and ionic conductivity among the examined electrolytes (Fig. S22, ESI†), underlining

the critical role of the interface structure in ion supply in electroreduction processes. Taken together, we conclude the synchronous eﬀect of anion polarity on regulating solvation sheath and EDL structure, as illustrated in Fig. 2j. Specifically, the strong-polarity Ac(cid:2) features strong coordination and adsorption capability that is capable of generating a more condensed interface micro-environment, which is anticipated to tackle the multiple issues in Zn metal anodes.

To experimentally validate the hypothesis, chronoampero- metry (CA) measurements were conducted to compare Zn deposition behavior in the investigated electrolytes (Fig. 3a). In the baseline electrolyte, a continuous increase in current response over 1000 s indicates rampant 2D diﬀusion, which accelerates dendrite growth.19 In contrast, dual-anion electro- lytes all manifest a steady 3D diﬀusion process following transient 2D diﬀusion, corresponding to 200 s for 2F-07A, 400 s for 2F-07FA and 500 s for 2F-01A, respectively. The alteration in the deposition behavior is attributed to the fact that the adsorbed anions can restrain lateral Zn2+ diﬀusion. The Tafel plots show that the 2F-07A electrolyte has the lowest exchange current density (Fig. 3b and Fig. S23, ESI†), indicating the most significant reduction in the corrosion rate.39 Addi- tionally, the linear sweep voltammetry characterization and calculated LUMO energy levels in diﬀerent electrolytes collec- tively confirm that water-related side reactions are pronounc- edly inhibited in 2F-07A (Fig. S24 and S25, ESI†). Accordingly, the tailored 2F-07A electrolyte demonstrates greatly improved anticorrosion ability with a smooth Zn surface after immersion (Fig. S26, ESI†). Furthermore, Zn deposition dynamics was evaluated by calculating active energy for the de-solvation process via temperature-dependent electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements (Fig. 3c and Fig. S27, ESI†) based on the law of Arrhenius equation.40–42 2F-07A electrolyte manifests the lowest charge transfer resistance (Rct) at all temperatures, suggesting that strong-polarity Ac(cid:2) can facilitate the charge transfer dynamics. Besides, 2F-07A demonstrates an apparently lower active energy of 35.9 kJ mol(cid:2)1 than its counter- parts, reducing the possibility of HER occurrence in IHP.

The distribution of relaxation times (DRT) derived from EIS can further probe interface electrochemical processes with diverse relaxation times (t) (Fig. 3d–g).43 Within the measured temperature range, the peaks with t of E10(cid:2)3 to 10(cid:2)1 s and 100 to 101 s represent charge transfer and interfacial diffusion, respectively. The peak area can be converted to the impedance value. Meanwhile, the diffusion impedance increases with the order of 2F-07A (Fig. 3d), 2F-01A (Fig. 3f), 2F-07FA (Fig. 3e), and the baseline (Fig. 3g), due to changes in the concentration of Zn2+ at the interface. This contrast further emphasizes the capability of strong-polarity Ac(cid:2) in attracting Zn2+ for a more condensed interface structure.

Thus, based on theoretical simulations and experimental findings, the functions of the four electrolytes in the bulk solvation and interfacial EDL can be drawn as follows: (i) The baseline electrolyte possesses both weak regulations in the bulk and at the interface; (ii) 2F-01A exhibits robust interface regula- tion but modest regulation in the bulk; (iii) 2F-07FA exhibits

strong regulation in the bulk but weak interface regulation; (iv) 2F-07A synchronically exhibits prominent regulation in the bulk and at the interface.

In situ microscopy observations during the Zn plating pro- cess at 5 mA cm(cid:2)2 are further conducted to confirm the merit of synchronized regulation. As shown in Fig. 3h, the baseline electrolyte appears to produce unevenly distributed protrusions after 5 mA h cm(cid:2)2 of deposition. In sharp contrast, the employ- ment of 2F-07A can greatly mitigate the dendrite growth under identical conditions and achieves a smooth surface even at a plating capacity of up to 30 mA h cm(cid:2)2. Correspondingly, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images after 30 mA h cm(cid:2)2 of deposition display a flat and dense morphology with tightly packed bricks in 2F-07A (Fig. 3i), whereas the baseline electrolyte showcases bulk aggregates and fluﬀy flakes (Fig. 3j). For 2F-01A and 2F-07FA, randomly distributed by-products and dendritic Zn are also observed (Fig. S28 and S29, ESI†), which can impair the interface homogeneity during electrodeposition and in turn exacerbate dendrite growth. Meanwhile, atomic force micro- scopy (AFM) images of the Zn electrode after cycling in 2F-07A

at 5 mA cm(cid:2)2 demonstrate a flatter surface without the observa- tion of large flakes (Fig. S30, ESI†).

To evaluate the electrochemical performance of dual-anion electrolytes, symmetric Zn8Zn cells are examined under diﬀer- ent conditions. Fig. 4a shows a comparison of the voltage profiles of Zn8Zn cells in diﬀerent electrolytes at 1 mA cm(cid:2)2 and 1 mA h cm(cid:2)2. As expected, the cell with the 2F-07A electrolyte exhibits an extended lifespan of over 2400 h, around 40-fold enhancement as compared to the baseline one (B60 h). For 2F-01A and 2F-07FA electrolytes, the stable plating/strip- ping profile sustains 350 h and 130 h, respectively. Meanwhile, the rate performance of Zn8Zn cells was tested at varying current densities ranging from 1 mA cm(cid:2)2 to 20 mA cm(cid:2)2 with a fixed cycling time of 1 h, followed by a constant current density of 10 mA cm(cid:2)2 and a capacity of 10 mA h cm(cid:2)2 (Fig. 4b and Fig. S31, ESI†). The cell at the baseline short circuits at 5 mA cm(cid:2)2 and 5 mA h cm(cid:2)2. In the cases of 2F-01A and 2F-07FA, the cells deliver an enhanced rate capability and fail at 20 mA cm(cid:2)2, 20 mA h cm(cid:2)2 and 15 mA cm(cid:2)2, 15 mA h cm(cid:2)2, respectively. Contrastively, the cell using the 2F-07A electrolyte

manifests stable voltage hysteresis at all rates and can con- tinuously cycle up to 3200 h after the test condition back to 10 mA cm(cid:2)2 and 10 mA h cm(cid:2)2.

Even under rather demanding conditions of 15 mA cm(cid:2)2 and 15 mA h cm(cid:2)2, the cell in the 2F-07A electrolyte enables a lifespan of 742 h (Fig. S32, ESI†). Note that high-capacity metal electrodes have garnered extensive attention for practical applications.44–46 Fig. 4c and Table S3 (ESI†) compare the Zn8Zn cells using the 2F-07A electrolyte with the recently reported works on electrolyte-regulated Zn electrodes in terms

of current density, area capacity (Z5 mA h cm(cid:2)2) and cumula- tive capacity. Evidently, the 2F-07A electrolyte-equipped cell stands out with a splendid accumulative plating capacity of 15.25 A h cm(cid:2)2 (3050 h). To simulate the intermittent operation of the cell in an actual working scenario, the cell using 2F-07A cycling is subjected to 1 mA cm(cid:2)2 and 1 mA h cm(cid:2)2 with 24 h intervals, which can operate for more than 6000 h (Fig. S33, ESI†). Temperature adaptability of the 2F-07A electrolyte was also examined. As shown in Fig. 4d, the cell with 2F-07A presents a stable cycling behavior even at low temperatures

down to (cid:2)30 1C. After pre-cycling at room temperature (RT) to stabilize the interface, the cell with 2F-07A can stably cycle at 2 mA cm(cid:2)2 and 1 mA h cm(cid:2)2 exceeding 250 h at 60 1C (Fig. 4e). These results demonstrate that the designed 2F-07A electrolyte holds great application potential over a wide temperature range.

Coulombic eﬃciency (CE) is a critical indicator to determine the electrode reversibility during charging/discharging cycles. A modified Aurbach method was carried out to minimize substrate interference by Zn8Cu asymmetric cells at 5 mA cm(cid:2)2 (Fig. 4f).47 The cells using Ac(cid:2)-containing electrolyte reveal a high CE of 99.1% for 2F-07A and 99.0% for 2F-01A, superior to that of 2F-07FA (97.6%) and the baseline (short circuit during charging). Long-term cycling reversibility of Zn8Cu asymmetric cells was also measured for comparison. At 1 mA cm(cid:2)2 and 1 mA h cm(cid:2)2 (Fig. 4g, top and Fig. S34, ESI†), the Ac(cid:2)- containing electrolytes oﬀer a stable CE of around 99% over 600 cycles, exceeding that using 2F-07FA (o80 cycles) and the baseline (o50 cycles). Thereupon, varying current densities ranging from 1 mA cm(cid:2)2 to 10 mA cm(cid:2)2 were applied (Fig. 4g, bottom and Fig. S35, ESI†). The 2F-07A electrolyte exhibits an average CE of 98.4% at 10 mA cm(cid:2)2 and 10 mA cm(cid:2)2 over 200 cycles, whereas drastic fluctuations are observed sequen- tially in the baseline, 2F-07FA, and 2F-01A, further highlighting the significance of synchronous regulation of the bulk solvation and interface under high currents and large capacities.

The surface morphology and composition of Zn electrodes cycled at 1 mA cm(cid:2)2 after 50 cycles in diﬀerent electrolytes were examined. Note that the cell using the baseline electrolyte prematurely short-circuited along with massive by-products covering the Zn metal and large protrusions entangling the separator (Fig. S36, ESI†). By contrast, the X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) peaks assigned to by-products are negligible in dual- anion electrolytes. SEM images reveal that the surface of the Zn electrode in the 2F-07A electrolyte is highly homogeneous and densely packed relative to that in 2F-01A and 2F-07FA (Fig. S37, ESI†). The chemical composition of the interfacial layer in dual- anion electrolytes was analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with Ar+ sputtering (Fig. 5a). For the depth profile of F 1s spectra, the peak can be deconvoluted into inorganic ZnF2 (B684.7 eV) and organic –CF3 (B688.4 eV) where the ascendancy of ZnF2 with extended sputtering time largely arises from the OTf(cid:2) decomposition. A similar trend can be seen in the S 2p spectra, which can be fitted into –CF3SO3 (B169.5 eV) and ZnS (B162.4 eV). In O 1s spectra, the surface of the interphase is dominated by organic species (S–O or CQO) at B532.8 eV and ZnCO3 at B532.2 eV. The observation of ZnCO3 can be ascribed to the presence of dissolved CO2 in the electrolyte and the decomposition of coordinated anions during cycling.31,48,49 A new peak assigned to ZnO or Zn(OH)2 (B530.6 eV) appears after etching and gradually dominates the oxygen-containing components over 180 s of etching. In addi- tion, the C 1s spectra display a ZnCO3 signal centered at B290.0 eV and Ac(cid:2)-derived (ROCO2)Zn at B288.5 eV. The ratio of ZnCO3 to (ROCO2)Zn increases with the sputtering depth. Thus, it can be concluded that organic components

predominate in the outer layer of the SEI, imparting flexibility to accommodate the volume fluctuation of the electrode, while inorganic compounds occupying the body of the SEI act as a robust armour for protecting the Zn electrode from dendrite growth.10,49,50 Fig. S38 and S39 (ESI†) illustrate the SEI compo- sitions for 2F-01A and 2F-07FA. It is discernible that the F 1s and S 1s signals from 2F-01A are notably weaker than the others, suggesting that the regulation in the bulk solvation is too weak to generate an anion-derived inorganic SEI.

Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) was conducted to acquire information on the chemical compo- sition and spatial distribution of the SEI formed in 2F-07A and 2F-07FA electrolytes (Fig. 5b and c). The signal of ZnO(cid:2)/ZnOH(cid:2) species in both electrolytes is apparently stronger than that of (cid:2), and S(cid:2) throughout the interphase, verifying that ZnF(cid:2), CO3 ZnO(cid:2)/ZnOH(cid:2) is the major component of the SEI. The corres- ponding SEI thickness in the 2F-07A electrolyte is determined to be B399 nm, thinner than that of the 2F-07FA counterpart (B608 nm). The signal intensity of ZnO(cid:2)/ZnOH(cid:2), ZnF(cid:2), and S(cid:2) manifests apparent irregularity in 2F-07FA compared to those in 2F-07A, suggesting that the Zn2+-scarce interface is inclined to induce inhomogeneous deposition. The quantitative com- parison of the ion fragment within 500 s of etching time and the integral of the component contents in all etched areas (3000 s) (Fig. 5d and Fig. S40 and S41, ESI†) distinctly revealed a lower electrolyte consumption for interphase construction in 2F-07A, which demonstrates Zn-enriched EDL contributes to a dense SEI. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was further employed to characterize the composition of the SEI layer formed in 2F-07A, where the lattice fringes of Zn(OH)2, ZnF2 and ZnCO3 were observed, in good accordance with XPS and ToF-SIMS results (Fig. S42, ESI†). Fig. 5e schematically illustrates the disparity in SEI evolution with the addition of Ac(cid:2) and TFA(cid:2) characterized by diﬀerent polarities, where the incorporation of strong-polarity Ac(cid:2) into the baseline facilitates Zn2+ desolvation and ion adsorption at the interface, favoring the formation of a uniform and compact SEI. Collectively, we conclude two pivotal prerequisites for electrolyte optimization towards dendrite-suppressed and side reaction-moderated cycling behavior at high currents/capacities: (i) Zn2+ at the interface is able to promptly compensate for the consumption during the electroreduction process, thus averting the exten- sion of deposited Zn into the bulk electrolyte; (ii) Zn2+-solvation structure can decompose into a beneficial SEI, isolating elec- trode–electrolyte contact and inhibiting dendrite growth.

To verify the practical feasibility of the designed dual-anion electrolyte, hybrid supercapacitors were fabricated by coupling Zn foil with an activated carbon (AC) cathode, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 6a. The Nyquist plots of the supercapacitors with 2F-07A show the smallest charge transfer resistance as compared to that of 2F-07FA and the baseline (Fig. 6b), imply- ing the superior charge storage capability of 2F-07A. Fig. 6c shows a comparison of the rate capability of the supercapacitor with diﬀerent electrolytes at varying rates. As expected, the supercapacitor with 2F-07A harvests a higher capacity of 98.9, 87.8, 74.6, 60.8, and 56.9 mA h g(cid:2)1 at 0.3, 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 A g(cid:2)1,

respectively, relative to the counterparts. Likewise, the Zn sur- face in 2F-07A after the rate test is more homogeneous (Fig. S43, ESI†). CV curves of the Zn8AC supercapacitor using 2F-07A show typical capacitive behavior while those using the baseline electrolyte inevitably suﬀer from side reactions during charging (Fig. S44, ESI†). Furthermore, the 2F-07A electrolyte- based supercapacitor (cathode loading: B12 mg cm(cid:2)2) mani- fests slow capacity attenuation over 3000 cycles. In sharp contrast, the supercapacitor with the baseline electrolyte dis- plays a pronounced capacity decline after 1500 cycles (Fig. 6d and Fig. S45, ESI†).

To meet the practical application, the supercapacitors were further evaluated under harsh conditions of ultrathin thin Zn (B10 mm) and low N/P (negative capacity to positive foil capacity: 5). As shown in Fig. 6e, the 2F-07A electrolyte enables the supercapacitor to retain 83% of the initial capacity for 300 cycles, whereas the one with the baseline electrolyte suﬀers from severe capacity loss, retaining 66% of the initial capacity for 150 cycles. The superior stability in the 2F-07A electrolyte can be attributed to the prompt compensation of Zn2+ at the interface and dense SEI formation, which eﬀectively inhibit side reactions and dendrite growth. Upon further increasing

the mass loading of the AC cathode up to 18.74 mg cm(cid:2)2 with a lean 2F-07A electrolyte (3 mL mg(cid:2)1), a decent capacity retention of 88% over 1500 cycles is achieved (Fig. S46, ESI†). The long- term cycling stability of the pouch-type Zn8AC supercapacitor using 2F-07A is shown in Fig. 6f, delivering a specific capacity of 80 mA h g(cid:2)1 at 0.5 A g(cid:2)1 with negligible capacity decay over 1200 cycles. To demonstrate the versatility of 2F-07A, Zn–air batteries (ZABs) were also assembled and tested at different temperatures (Fig. 6g). The room-temperature ZAB in 2F-07A exhibits a long lifespan of over 1300 h, far outperforming the battery in the baseline electrolyte that operates within 300 h (Fig. 6h). Even at a high temperature (60 1C), 2F-07A electrolyte- equipped ZAB can sustain an enhanced lifespan (240 h) com- pared to that in the baseline (180 h) (Fig. 6i), largely arising from the stable and robust interface (Fig. S47, ESI†) and superior water retention capability in the 2F-07A electrolyte (Fig. S48, ESI†).

Conclusions

In this contribution, we adopt the anion polarity as a general indicator for constructing dual-anion electrolytes in a compara- tive framework, which screens a dual-anion electrolyte that enables synchronous adjustment of the solvation structure and the EDL towards the durable Zn electrode. The incorpora- tion of strong-polarity Ac(cid:2) into the baseline electrolyte of 2M Zn(OTf)2 promotes the formation of an anion-enriched solva- tion shell and a Zn2+-enriched condensed interface layer. In addition, the coordinated OTf(cid:2) is capable of decomposing into major constituents of the SEI. Collectively, the dual-anion electrolyte can eﬀectively inhibit dendrite growth and water- induced side reactions, ensuring uniform deposition and long- term operation under high currents and capacities as well as wide temperatures. Impressively, the dual-anion electrolyte with synchronous regulation ability enables the Zn8Zn cell to deliver a cumulative plating capacity of 15.25 A h cm(cid:2)2 (3050 h)

at 10 mA cm(cid:2)2 and 10 mA h cm(cid:2)2, surpassing state-of-the-art high-capacity Zn electrodes. Furthermore, hybrid Zn2+ capaci- tors and Zn–air batteries using the tailored electrolyte manifest improved electrochemical performance. This work sheds light on the polarity combination of anions in synchronous manip- ulation of bulk solvation and the interfacial EDL, advancing the research of anion chemistry in metal electrode protection.
